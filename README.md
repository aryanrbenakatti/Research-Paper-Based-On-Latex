## Project Overview

Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field with the potential to revolutionize numerous industries. This paper reviews foundational algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's algorithms, discusses developments in quantum hardware, and explores applications in optimization, simulation, and secure communication.

The paper is structured for submission to IEEE conferences and is formatted according to the IEEEtran LaTeX template.


### Key Files:

- `main.tex`: The primary LaTeX file that includes all sections, figures, and citations.
- `IEEEtran.cls`: The IEEE conference template for formatting.
- `references.bib`: The bibliography file that stores all citations in BibTeX format.
- `image1.jpeg`, `image2.jpeg`: Sample images for the figures in the paper (you can replace these with actual images of your choosing).

## Technologies Used

- **LaTeX**: For creating the document.
- **IEEEtran Class**: For IEEE-compliant formatting.
- **BibTeX**: For managing references and citations.
- **amsmath, graphicx, cite**: Various LaTeX packages for formatting equations, inserting graphics, and managing references.

## How to Compile

1. **Install LaTeX Distribution**:
   - Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed on your machine. Common choices include [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux/Windows or [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS.

2. **Compile Using Command Line**:
   If you have LaTeX installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pdflatex main.tex
   bibtex main.aux
   pdflatex main.tex
   pdflatex main.tex
